-> dragstart applied to all tiles with a piece not of type none(makeMove function)
-> dragstart event fired = get piece from pieces
-> get all move x's and y's from selected piece
-> get all tiles that correspond to move x's and y's
-> set canMoveHere=true for those tiles, set data-canMoveHere=true for corresponding element
-> apply .can-move-here style and drop for tiles that have dataset.canMoveHere=true
-> on dragend and drop remove styles and invoke makeMove()

-> makeMove()
-> if destination tile has piece, put it in capturedPieces
-> set pieceToMove to destination tile

refactor x/y to be consistently row/col instead of having to guess which is which!!!!!!!!

move execution internal logic:
	store reference to previous tile | this comes from DOM
	remove previous tile						 | need to also remove from DOM
	grab reference to target tile		 | this comes from DOM
	remove target tile						   | need to also remove from DOM
	create new piece with data from previoustile, with updated x and y, add to new tile
	create new tile with target tile x and y and add the piece to it
	create new tile with previous x and y with none-piece

	remove and add the elements to the DOM
