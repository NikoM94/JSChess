undoMove and redoMove are complicated to implement:
must store game history, then be able to reload any
stored stated from history

approaches:
- clone board and store a reference to each board state
	i dont like this, there should only be 1 instance of Board that is mutated, otherwise can get very confusing with references
- keep past board states stored as FEN strings
	keep track of move history in PGN format, object with
	k,v turnNumber,movePair


-implementations:
	BoardState class to keep track of past board states
	keeps Board class clean, BoardState is a member of Board

	BoardState:
	- has reference to Board
		methods:
			updateState(move, currentTurn):
				store current board state and store move as PGN
			loadSpecifiedState(int turnNumber):
				when user clicks a move on the UI, load the clicked state
			previousState():
				load previous state as long as there is one
			nextState():
				load next state as long as there is one

			has helper functions in boardutils.js
			e.g. loadFromFEN(), createPGN() etc.
			may have to refactor how Board is instantiated to load
			initial board config from FEN, parsing PGN files
			might be necessary for unit testing
